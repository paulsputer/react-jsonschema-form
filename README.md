## Usage with Bootstrap 4

Since Bootstrap 4 no longer includes Glyphicons, you need to use [Font
Awesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/) instead. You can do this by adding
the following to your index.html file:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.3/css/all.css"
